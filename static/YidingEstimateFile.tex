        Question 1
        \begin{enumerate}
            
        \item[a) ]Discuss why sometimes it is sensible to deliver an incomplete software product and then issue new versions after delivery. Give a specific example of such a software product you have used during the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe how the software product adapted to the rapid changing situation with incremental delivery.

            \textbf{[9 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[b) ]The COVID-19 crisis has forced many company employees to work from home. What are the impacts of working from home on an Agile software development team? What can the team do to minimise the impacts? Discuss TWO areas of impact and propose your solutions.

        \textbf{Question 2}

          A start-up company has decided to develop an online streaming platform. You are a member of their Agile software development team and you are aware that there are some big competitors in the field (e.g., Netflix). You are worried because your team leader seems reluctant to focus on the architectural aspects of the system. Your worries increase when your team leader sketches the following architecture on the whiteboard during a team meeting
        \begin{enumerate}
            
        \item[a) ]Highlight the importance and advantages of focusing more on the system architecture;
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[5 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[b) ]Your team plans to follow an agile software development approach, explain if this will be achievable or not while putting more emphasis on developing the architecture;
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[6 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[c) ]Explain the limits of the simple architectural model sketched in Figure 1, make reference to the problem scenario;
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[6 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[d) ]Propose modifications that can be made to this simple architectural model to cope better with the problem scenario. Sketch the result with a diagram and discuss it.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[8 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \end{enumerate}
        ~\\
    
        \textbf{Question 3}

          The company mentioned in the above question 2 launched the online streaming platform. It has been very successful until a similar new product with better features was introduced into the market by its competitor. The company has to improve its product to include more features to catch up with the market, but unfortunately the chief software engineer resigned to join its competitor. The company has no immediate replacement for her as she was the only senior software engineer in the company.
        \begin{enumerate}
            
        \item[a) ]Identify and discuss TWO types of risks involved in the start-up company.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[5 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[b) ]Discuss what the start-up company failed to do which could have prevented the problem they are facing.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[8 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[c) ]Provide ONE short-term and ONE long-term advice to the start-up company on how to get back into the market quickly.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[12 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \end{enumerate}
        ~\\
    
        \textbf{Question 4}

          Question 4
        \begin{enumerate}
            
        \item[a) ]An important aspect of good quality programming is to keep a clear distinction between what an object as defined by a class does, and how it does it. Explain the meaning of the statement and why it is important.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[8 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[b) ]Explain how the decorator design pattern works, and why it is a good technique for modifying the way an object works.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[8 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
    
        \item[c) ]Write a class FailStorer that uses the decorator design pattern so that any time the method move is called and returns false, the Position that was its argument is added to a set of Positions. The class must also have a method getFailPositions() that returns the set of Positions created, and resets the set to store Positions to an empty set.
        \begin{flushright}
            \textbf{[9 marks]}
        \end{flushright}
